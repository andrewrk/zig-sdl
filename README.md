# zig-sdl

Self-contained SDL2 package for Zig.

## Current Status

I'm able to build libSDL2.a and then link an application against it,
but I didn't get past this problem yet:

```
$ zig build run
INFO: Unable to initialize SDL: No available video device
```

Probably need to do some kind of build configuration thing.

## How to Use this Package

I'm still experimenting. Don't try to use it yet.
